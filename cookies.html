Third-party cookies are set by organizations other than the website owner, such as analytics companies, advertising networks, and social media platforms.

Persistent cookies remain on your device for the period specified in the cookie (from a few minutes to several years). They are activated each time you visit the website that created that particular cookie.

You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of our website may become inaccessible or not function properly. The methods for managing cookies vary by browser, but are typically found in the "Options," "Tools," or "Preferences" menu.

For targeted advertising cookies, you can visit the Digital Advertising Alliance's opt-out page (optout.aboutads.info) or the Network Advertising Initiative's opt-out page (optout.networkadvertising.org). These industry-developed programs allow you to opt out of interest-based advertising from participating companies. Please note that opting out doesn't mean you won't see ads - it means the ads you see may be less relevant to your interests. Also, these opt-outs are device and browser specific, so you'll need to opt out on each device and browser you use.</p>

Currently, our website does not respond to DNT browser signals because no industry standard for DNT has been adopted. We continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and will reassess our approach if a standard emerges.

This includes obtaining explicit consent before placing non-essential cookies, providing clear information about cookie usage, and making it easy for users to withdraw consent.

                    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect cookies and the data they contain. This includes using secure, HTTP-only flags for authentication cookies to prevent access via client-side scripts, and secure flags to ensure cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS connections. We regularly review our cookie usage to identify and mitigate potential security risks. Session cookies are given limited lifespans and automatically expire after periods of inactivity. We implement same-site cookie attributes to protect against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
