                    <p>We will share your personal information with third parties only when we have your explicit consent to do so.

                    <p>We engage trusted third-party companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf, such as website hosting, payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, and customer service. These service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are contractually prohibited from using it for other purposes. We carefully vet all service providers and require them to maintain appropriate security measures to protect your information.</p>

This includes responding to lawful requests from public authorities, such as subpoenas, court orders, or other legal processes.</p>

                    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include encryption, firewalls, secure socket layer (SSL) technology, regular security audits, and access controls. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

                    <p>In the event of a data breach that compromises your personal information, we have established procedures to promptly investigate the breach, assess the risk to individuals, and notify affected users and relevant authorities as required by applicable law. Our response may include steps to mitigate harm, such as resetting passwords, temporarily disabling accounts, or providing credit monitoring services where appropriate. We document all breaches, regardless of their size or impact, to improve our security practices.</p>

                    <p>While we work hard to protect your information, you also play an important role in maintaining security. We encourage you to use strong, unique passwords for your BiteNestle account and to avoid sharing your login credentials with others. Be cautious about the personal information you choose to share in public areas of our site, such as recipe comments or community forums, as this information may be viewed by other users and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.</p>

You can review and update much of your account information by logging into your BiteNestle account.

                    <p>Where applicable by law, you may request a copy of your personal information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. This allows you to transfer your data to another service provider if desired. We will provide your information in a format that is readily usable and, where technically feasible, may transmit it directly to another organization at your request. There may be limitations to this right based on legal requirements or technical constraints.</p>

                    <p>You may request deletion of your personal information in certain circumstances, such as when the data is no longer necessary for the purposes collected, you withdraw consent, or the data was processed unlawfully. Note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, to complete transactions, or to comply with legal obligations. After deletion, your information will be permanently erased from our active systems, though residual copies may remain in backups for a limited period.</p>

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to modify settings to decline cookies or alert you when cookies are being sent. If you disable cookies, some features of our website may not function properly. We also provide cookie preference tools on our site that allow you to opt out of certain non-essential cookies while maintaining essential functionality.

                    <p>Some browsers offer a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that lets you indicate you prefer not to be tracked across websites. Currently, we do not respond to DNT signals because no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing these signals has been established. We continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and will reassess our approach if a standard emerges. In the meantime, you can manage tracking through cookie settings and the privacy controls we provide.</p>

The specific retention period depends on the nature of the information and the purpose for which it is processed. For example, we retain account information for as long as your account is active, and transaction data for the period required by tax laws.

These backups may retain copies of your information for a limited period even after you request deletion, until the backups are refreshed in accordance with our standard procedures.

This archived data is typically anonymized or aggregated so it cannot be linked back to individuals. For example, we might retain anonymized recipe ratings and comments to analyze food trends over time, but would remove any identifiers linking this data to specific users if those users delete their accounts.</p>
